Members take more trips during the weekdays than Casual users do, who take the most trips during the weekend.\n\n**final conclusion based on your analysis?**\n* different people use differently according to their needs.\n\n**How could your team and business apply your insights?**\n* The insights could be implemented when preparing a marketing campaign for turning casual into members. The marketing can have a focus on workers as a fit and environment friendly way to go work as they msut be tired of sititng all day.\n\n**What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?**\n* we could do more analysis on considering different features like age and climate. Can further search why there is no memeber who use docked bike we can focus on incraesing docked bike sale if stakeholder wants.\n\n**Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?**\n- obility data.\n- climate data.\n- members information.\n- some surveys if exist.\n\n\n**Deliverable:**\n- ads campaigns can focus on perks of being active or taking your partner or kids on date on weekends.\n- increase benefit for riding in cold months\n- can give casual rider discount or perks.\n","metadata":{}}]}
